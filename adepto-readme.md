### Problem/solution

Having learnt Ruby on Rails and really enjoying developer experience using the command line to generate generic templates of code, migrations and perform database operations form the command line, I felt that there wasn't any similar experiences with Javascript and decided to set out to create my own framework based on Rails but incoporating React and NodeJS.

Nails is an attempt at creating a solution and adding to the growing open source pool of frameworks and packages of the Javascript community. It is my attempt at creating a solid software architecture that is tightly integrated with a framework that helps you easily and rapidly generate boiler plate code and perform database operations from the command line. With future iterations I plan to add more features to make the framework more robust and powerful and a valuable tool to compete with Rails and provide a good learning platform for people new to programming.

### Choices I made in the design process of this project

This project has been an iterative process of figuring how to structure my code efficiently to make it easily understandable and as dry as possible. I enjoy creating apps/software that is modular in nature.
