### Problem/solution

At Coder Academy we learnt how to use Ruby on Rails (RoR), React, and NodeJS.

I really enjoyed the development experience of RoR, using the command line to generate generic templates of code, migrations and perform database operations form the command line. But when it came to learning React and NodeJS I enjoyed the freshness of a newer technology and more dynamic UI (with react) and I enjoyed the freedom of having control over how the architecture of the NodeJS backend played out and being able to separate front end from backend.

I took on the challenge of building a full stack framework for Javascript (JS) because I could see how powerful RoR was with the ability of rapidly generating applications and I wanted to create a similar experience with a JS framework.

Nails is an attempt at creating a solution and adding to the growing open source pool of frameworks and packages of the Javascript community. It is my attempt at creating a solid software architecture that is tightly integrated with a framework that helps you easily and rapidly generate boiler plate code and perform database operations from the command line.

With future iterations I plan to add more features to make the framework more robust and powerful and a valuable tool for the JS community to make use of.

### Choices I made in the design process of this project

This project has been an iterative process of figuring how to structure my code efficiently to make it easily understandable and as dry as possible. I enjoy creating apps/software that is modular in nature.
